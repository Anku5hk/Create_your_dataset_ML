<h5>What to do with the dataset?</h5>
This dataset can used to predict spam, sort your chats and maybe make use into a NLP project of yours. If you have tons of chats going on onto messenging, then this is the time you use it to create a Chatbot project.<br>
<h5>How to begin?</h5>
Get the dataset currently from messaging app on android only.<br>
Download a backup creating app.<br>
I would recommend the SMS Backup & Restore app from playstore: <br>
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore&hl=en_IN <br>
Backup all your texts from the phone as .xml(default option). Just backup from whatever way you prefer just it should be .xml<br>
Move it to your computer and provide the location of .xml into given .py script.<br>
Run the .py script.<br>
Create a new Jupyter Notebook, load the dataset.<br>
Boom, Done !!! you can work on whatever you want to work on.<br>
